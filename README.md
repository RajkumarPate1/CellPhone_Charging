Designed a system that will charge a cell phone when a coin is inserted for people who live in semi-urban and rural areas of India where there is a shortage of electricity.

Implemented a coin recognition algorithm that detects a valid coin and signals the microcontroller to start charging the mobile through a power supply.

Tools used: Arduino IDE
